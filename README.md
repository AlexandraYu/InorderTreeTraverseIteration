# InorderTreeTraverseIteration
Traverse a binary tree with iteration
Normally we traverse a tree with recurssive method, but actually we can do so with iteration method as well. Here we'll try in-order. 
So given a tree like this: 

       1   
      /  \
    2     3
   / \
  4   5

The in-order traverse is 4, 2, 5, 1, 3
Remember, in-order means left, root, right
